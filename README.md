# Dropwizard Scratch Project

## Overview

This is a test project to allow me to familiarize myself with the Dropwizard framework.

## Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Maven

## Installation

Build the app with `mvn package`

## Usage

Run the app with `java -jar dropwizard-scratch-VERSION.jar server CONFIG_FILE`

The application supports three endpoints.

* /src - `GET` request receives a source JSON model response
* /dest - accepts `POST` requests with a destination JSON model body
* /transform - a `POST` request causes the app to call the /src endpoint, map the source model JSON to destination model JSON and forward it to the /dest endpoint

## Configuration

The example configuration for the app is included in the conf/ directory.
